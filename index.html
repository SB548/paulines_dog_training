      <h2 class="title">About</h2>
      <p>I use fun, effective and kind training methods to make learning simple and to build a strong relationship between dog and human. I will design an easy to understand training program that will set you both up for success.  
        Science tells us that behaviour that is rewarded is repeated. Training should be a fun and rewarding experience for both dog and human with methods that build mutual trust and respect. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I started this business to share my dedication to dogs and to help people create and enhance their bond with their furry companions. 
        I believe the amazing friendship I share with my dog, Dinky, is something that everyone should experience. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I love working with puppies (who doesnâ€™t), rescue dogs, little dogs, big dogs, medium sized dogs and sometimes even cats, rabbits, guinea pigs and chooks. 
I love what I do and look forward to continuing to share my passion with you and your furry friends.
